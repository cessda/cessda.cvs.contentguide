The copyright statement and the citation are automatically produced by the system at CV
publication both for SL and TLs. Please check after publication that the citation is present and correct,
since you cannot see it before publication. If it needs to be edited, contact the Service Owner.

SL admin selects the licence in the ‘Add CV’ pop-up window when creating the vocabulary.
Only the licences entered into the system can be selected.
Licence information is mandatory and the system prevents saving the CV if it is not selected.

Licences available in the CESSDA Vocabulary Service system are entered by the Service Owner.
SL admins can add a default licence for the agency from the licence list in the Agency profile.
If the licence you need is not available in the system, contact the Service Owner.
DDI and CESSDA vocabularies use the same licence (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International).
