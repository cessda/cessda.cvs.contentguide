The copyright statement and the citation are automatically produced by the system at publication stage for SL and TL.
Please check after publication that the citation is present and correct, you cannot see it before publication.
If not, contact the Content Contact.

Source language licence: the licence for each SL vocabulary is chosen from a drop-down list when publishing the vocabulary for the first time.
Only the licences entered into the system are allowed and in the list.

Licences available in the CESSDA Vocabulary Service are entered by the Content Contact.
SL administrators can add a default licence for the agency in the Agency profile.
If the licence you need is not in the system, contact the Content Administrator to have it added.

Licence information is mandatory and the system prevents publication if it is not entered for the CV.

DDI and CESSDA vocabularies have the same licence in both source and target vocabularies (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International).
When entering a translation for the first time, take care to select the same licence as SL.
Currently, the system offers this by default.

Target language licence in general: Licence information is inherited from the source.
It can be edited if the licence for the source and target language differ.
