This is the Editor User Guide for for version 2.1.0 of the [CESSDA Vocabulary Service](https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/).

This guide covers the use of the CESSDA Vocabulary Service by users with the ‘Editor’ role.
It provides information on how to add a controlled vocabulary (CV) and its subsequent maintenance.

Each controlled vocabulary is created in a source language (SL).
Both CESSDA and DDI use English as the source language.
Once an SL of a CV has been published, a translation into another language, hereafter referred to as ‘target language’ (TL),
can be produced.
A vocabulary can be translated into multiple languages.

You must have an account and be logged in to the system to add or edit a vocabulary.
Depending on your role, you will be able to edit an SL vocabulary or one of the TLs at various stages in the workflow.
**Actions where extra care is required before finalising are noted in bold type, like this sentence.**
