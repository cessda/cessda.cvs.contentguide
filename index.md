# CESSDA Vocabulary Service Content Editors' Guide

This is the Content Editors' Guide for version x.x.x of the [CESSDA Vocabulary Service](https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/).

It covers the use of the CESSDA Vocabulary Service tool (CVS).
It provides information on how to add a controlled vocabulary (CV) to the tool and its subsequent maintenance.

Within the CVS, each controlled vocabulary is created in a source language (SL).
Both CESSDA and DDI use English as the source language.
Once an SL of a CV has been published, a translated version, hereafter referred to as ‘target language’ (TL), can be produced.
A vocabulary can be translated into multiple languages.

You must have a CVS account and be logged into the system to add or edit a vocabulary.
Depending on your role, you will be able to edit an SL vocabulary or one of the TLs at various stages in the workflow.
Actions where extra care is required before finalizing are noted in red, bold type, like this sentence.
