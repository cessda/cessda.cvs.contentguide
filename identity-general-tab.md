# {{ page.title }}

This tab contains the Canonical Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of
the version. This is produced automatically by the system at
publication for both SL and TL, based on the Canonical URI information
entered into the Agency profile and other information relating to the
CV. The URI cannot be seen in the DRAFT or REVIEW states before the
vocabulary is published for the first time.

The system requires the agency to have a Uniform Resource Name (URN).
If your agency does not have a URN, the CESSDA CV URN
(urn:ddi:int.cessda.cv:) can be used for 'Canonical URI'.

Check after publication that the URI has appeared and is correct. If
they are not, contact the Service Owner. Do not edit them here.

In TL, you can also add or edit the translating agency and a link to
it in this tab. This does not affect versioning.
