# {{ page.title }}

This is a simplified version of the lifecycle for creation and publication of a CV.

- Admin_SL creates a draft version of a CV in the source language. Other persons with relevant roles can now contribute, update, add to the CV.
- Admin_SL starts a review of the CV. Admin_SL finalises review. When satisfied the CV is correct, Admin_SL publishes the CV.
- The CV is now visible to everyone and translation of the CV into various languages can be started.
  Translators translate the codes and add the licence.
- Each translation can be published independently of other languages.
- Once a CV has been published, work on previous SL versions or translations of previous versions is halted.
  From this point, no-one can edit the previous SL version or translations of it.
  Translators add their translation of this new SL version but the system will automatically clone
  their previous translation as the draft to start from.
- A new version of translation can be done even if the SL has not changed, to correct mistakes etc.
