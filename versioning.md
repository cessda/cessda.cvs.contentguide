If a published CV needs amendments, SL Administrator makes the changes and publishes the new SL version.
Changes can be major (substantive) or minor (non-substantive).
A major change could be adding or deleting a code, or making changes to the code value.
Minor changes are, for example, changing the text in a definition without altering the meaning.
A full list of changes, both major and minor, are available on the DDI Alliance website.
CESSDA vocabularies have the same versioning policy.
Go to [http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies](http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies)
and expand the Versioning Policy section.

For the source CV the version is made of two parts, ‘n’ and ‘m’, e.g. 2.3.
The first part of the version number (n) shows major changes and the second (m) minor changes.

When publishing a CV version, the next minor version will be suggested.
This can be edited to be a major version change if required.
All changes within a CV should be checked to see whether the change should be major or minor.

Translated CVs are always based on a version of the source CV.
For example, the first German translation of the English CV version 3.4 will have the version 3.4.1. -
an extra digit is added to the end of the SL version.

For translated CVs there is no difference between major and minor changes in the versioning value -
the next version of a translated CV is created by adding one to the previous value.
So, following the previous example, the next version of the German CV will be 3.4.2.

When the source CV version number changes, the translated version will start again from 1.
